yascam - Yet Another Simple Cam
======= 

This class is meant to make simple 2.5 axis milling quick to code, particularly
for parts just slightly more complex than you feel like hand coding in NC code
but still simple enough that you don't feel like loading up CAD.

Working: 
- Milled Holes
- Basic Movement

To do:
- Facing
- Contours and pockets
- Import simple shapes?
